## **MATRIX MULTIPLICATION** 🔄
- Matrix-matrix multiplication using the `@` operator 🔗.
- Matrix-vector and vector-matrix multiplication 📐.
- Handling column and row vectors for multiplication ↔️.

## **Special Matrices** 🛠️
- Creating zero matrices (`np.zeros`), ones matrices (`np.ones`), identity matrices (`np.eye`), and diagonal matrices (`np.diag`) 🟰.

- Accessing specific elements or subsets in multi-dimensional arrays 📂.

## **Slicing** ✂️
- Slicing arrays to extract rows, columns, or sub-arrays (e.g., `x[0:3]`) 📏.
- Advanced slicing in 2D arrays (e.g., rows and columns) 🔪.
- Combining slicing with conditions for data extraction 🔍.

## **Sum of Rows** ➕
- Computing row-wise sums in matrices (e.g., `np.sum(matrix, axis=1)`) 📊
- Column-wise operations and aggregations 📈.
- Applying sums in data analysis contexts 📊.

## **Matplotlib** 🎨
- Basic plotting: line plots (`plt.plot`), scatter plots (`plt.scatter`), histograms (`plt.hist`) 📉.
- Image visualization (`plt.imshow`) 🖼️.
- Customization: titles, labels, legends, subplots, and displaying results ✨.

## **GMM** 📊
- Introduction to Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for clustering 🔄.
- Fitting GMM using scikit-learn (`GaussianMixture` model) 🤖.
- Parameter estimation (means, covariances) and visualization of clusters 📈.

## **RELU** ⚡
- ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function implementation (`np.maximum(0, x)`) 🔋.
- Usage in neural networks or simple models 🧠.
- Visualization of ReLU behavior on sample data 📊.

## **Covariance Matrix** 📊
- Computing covariance matrices (`np.cov`) 📐.
- Understanding outer products in covariance calculation (`np.outer`) 🔗.
- Applications in data analysis and dimensionality reduction 📉.

## **PCA** 🔍
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch 🛠️.
- Eigenvalue decomposition for principal components 🔢.
- Reducing dimensionality and transforming data 📏.

## **Visualization of PCA and Its Components** 📊
- Plotting principal components and explained variance 📉.
- Scatter plots of data projected onto PCA axes 📈.
- Visualizing loadings and component contributions ✨.

## **K-Means and Visualization** 🤖
- K-Means clustering from scratch (centroid initialization, assignment, update) 🔄.
- Visualizing clusters (e.g., scatter plots with color-coded labels) 🎨.

## **MNIST Visualization and PCA Perform on It 🔢**
- Loading and visualizing MNIST dataset (handwritten digits) 🖼️.
- Applying PCA for dimensionality reduction on MNIST 📉.
- Visualizing reduced-dimensional data and reconstruction 📊.

## **Image Segmentation of Rubik's Cube 🧊**
- Loading and reshaping images (e.g., RGB to array format) 🖼️.
- Applying K-Means for color-based segmentation (reducing colors) 🎨.
- Visualizing segmented images (e.g., mapping clusters to colors like red, green, blue, black) 🔴🟢🔵⚫.

The notebook emphasizes hands-on practice, with examples like applying K-Means to compress a 100x100 image by reducing it to 4 colors. It assumes basic Python knowledge and focuses on building ML intuition through code. 🚀
